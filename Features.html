              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Fundamentally, spiritual meditation is the conscious act of connecting with something greater, larger, and deeper than the specific self. Though it may seem counter-intuitive, the way to such a connection requires sincere introspection. Several meditation methods aim to raise spiritual consciousness, but they all need honesty and sincerity when it comes to how we perceive ourselves and the world. Meditation is practised in many ways according to various religions. Anyone can participate in a guided spiritual meditation, making mindful practice open to all faiths and religions. The benefits of spiritual meditation spread outward; as our awareness and spiritual security grow, so do our desire and capacity to help others.

Visualization is a meditation technique in which images, scenarios or feelings are visualized that provide immense peace and a sense of happiness and contentment. Many times, experiencing some feelings, being in some places  or with someone is not possible but with visualisation, this can be felt and seen, helping in release of happy hormones, and hence helping in mental and emotional stability. Medidation is very helpful in achieving mindfulness, that is being mentally active in all situations. By picturing and experiencing positive feelings and places, it is possible to focus on the present moment, letting go of past and future anxieties. Visualization is a powerful tool that can be used in conjunction with other meditation techniques to improve mental and emotional well-being.</p>
