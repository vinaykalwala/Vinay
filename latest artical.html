        <h2>Happy Life</h2>
        
        <p>
          A happy life is a feeling it comes when you enjoy your own life without any
          distractions. Many peoples think like happy life comes when they buy costly
          things, get a job, and satisfy others. These are not reasons for a happy life.
          Happy life people satisfy their soul, not others. It is very important in
          everyone's life. Happy life helps you do your best.

        <h2>
          greenhouse effect</h2>
        
        <P>
          Earth has not been the same as a few decades earlier. It did not use to be so
      hot, polluted, or devoid of rain. But now, the environment has become hotter,
      polluted everywhere, and the rain cycle has changed to the extreme. The root of
      all these problems is Global Warming which causes a temperature rise, which is
      caused by the Greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is called so because it
      imitates a glass greenhouse that is used to flourish plants in cold
      environments. A greenhouse traps the heat within, using certain atmospheric
      gases. This heat saves the plants from the harsh cold and helps them survive in
      lower temperatures just as they would do in normal temperatures.
