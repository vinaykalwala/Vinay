            <h1>GREY HAT HACKING AND IT’S MOTIVE</h1>

<h2>What is a Grey hat hacker?</h2>
<div class="b">A hacker who falls in between the white hat and black hat classifications
    is known as a grey hat hacker. While Grey hat hackers occasionally reveal
    vulnerabilities to the affected parties or the entire public, they occasionally use
    vulnerabilities for their own personal advantage.</p>
    There are exceptions to any generalization, which is why the idea of
    &quot;Grey hat&quot; hackers also exists. Hackers that use Grey hats fall in between
    &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; They are the ones that examine a system for flaws without
    authorization but maybe with good intentions. They could let a company know
    that they have found a way to abuse their system and then demand payment to
    have it fixed.</p>
    <p>
        The Grey Hat hacker may, however, turn into a Black Hat hacker by
publishing the point of exploitation online for everyone to see or even by
exploiting the vulnerability themselves if the organisation does not reply
promptly or if they do not comply at all. Because a Grey Hat hacker does not
have authorization to attempt to break into a system, their work is technically
illegal regardless of their motivations.
    </p>
<h3>Various kinds of grey hat hackers</h3>
<P>
    Grey hat hackers may be divided into two categories: those who hack for
personal gain and those who hack both for personal gain and to strengthen
security. The latter is occasionally referred to as a &quot;white hat with a black
heart.&quot; A contentious behavior that blurs the lines between lawful and illicit
conduct is &#39;grey hat hacking&#39;. While some grey hat hackers are only interested
in themselves, othershacking with the intention of raising security. Depending
on their goals, grey hat hackers&#39; actions can be both harmful and beneficial.
</P>
<h3 id="word">Grey hat hackers&#39; motives</h3>
<P> 
    Depending on the category, grey hat hackers have different goals. People
that hack for their own benefit could be driven by money or just enjoy the
challenge. There are a variety of reasons why people hack for both their own
benefit and to increase security, including the desire to make the world a better
place or to stop future assaults. Those that hack for political purposes also
exist. They can aim to overthrow a corrupt organisation or government.
Additionally, they can just do it for the excitement of it.
</P>
<h2>How can I learn grey hat hacking?</h2>
<P>
    The ideal technique to become a grey hat hacker depends on your skill
set and intentions, hence there is no universally applicable solution to this
issue. Finding weaknesses in software and systems and revealing them to the
concerned parties or the wider public are some methods to get started, though.

<h3>Grey Hat Resources for Hacking</h3>
<p>
    Books by Kevin Mitnick like &quot;The Art of Deception&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the
Wires&quot; are some of the greatest sources for learning more about grey hat
hacking.</p>
Another is the most complete reference for individuals interested in
ethical hacking, &quot;Grey Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker&#39;s Handbook, Sixth
Edition.&quot; This manual offers a thorough examination of the methods employed
by both unethical and ethical hackers as well as extensive, step-by-step
directions on how to strengthen computer networks using ethical hacking. This
book, which covers everything from software exploitation to SCADA assaults,
is without a doubt the ultimate manual for the discipline of ethical hacking. It
offers in-depth insights from real subject-matter authorities and includes
opulent visuals, understandable explanations, and useful examples to make
difficult subjects simple for readers to comprehend. This book is a great
resource for grey hat hackers due to its extensive covering of relevant topics.
</p>
<h3>Grey Hat Hacker Examples</h3>
<p>
    A security researcher by the name of Justin Shafer identified a weakness
in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) system used by a sizable healthcare
organization in 2016. This incident is one real-world instance of a grey hat
hacker in the healthcare sector. Without the required authority, Shafer was able
to access the system and discovered that it held private patient data, including
medical records and social security numbers.</p>
Shafer informed the healthcare organization about the problem and
volunteered to help solve it rather than trying to exploit the vulnerability or
harm the system.</p>
Shafer notified the company, but when they didn&#39;t reply, he ultimately posted
about the vulnerability on his own blog.</p>
<p id="word1">Despite Shafer&#39;s good intentions, several others found his access to the
EHR system without authority to be unethical. Additionally, the healthcare
facility could have chosen to conceal the vulnerability to prevent bad press or
legal ramifications.</p>
Shafer&#39;s revelation finally prompted the healthcare organisation to take
measures to enhance the security of its EHR system, notwithstanding the
criticism surrounding his conduct. In this way, the security of the system and
the safeguarding of patient data were eventually favourably influenced by
Shafer&#39;s efforts as a grey hat hacker.
</p>
<h3>Understanding the Grey Hat Hacker Space Is Important</h3>
<p>
    Understanding the grey hat hacker community is crucial because it may
be of great value to businesses. They may assist in creating stronger security
policies and practices, as well as in locating and repairing security flaws before
malevolent hackers have a chance to take advantage of them. Grey hat hackers,
in contrast to white hat hackers, may utilize their technological prowess to
circumvent cybersecurity defenses without authorization. White hat hackers
only attack vulnerabilities with consent and keep their findings secret until the
problem is resolved. In addition, they could publish their results or even
commercialize them illegally. This implies that in order to defend themselves
against malicious attacks, organizations must be aware of potential network
vulnerabilities.
</p>
<h2 id="word2">What are grey hat hackers doing?</h2>
<p>
    If we view the white hats as the police and the black hats as criminals,
then the grey hats stand in as the slightly shady investigator. Dark cap
programmers are kind of like smart men; they illegally get into technical
systems in a similar way as a dark cap, but they regard the information they
acquire as a white cap. This could entail disclosing the information to the
organization covertly to enable them to correct the flaw, similar to a robber
informing a victim that they left the tap running while they were away. It could
also involve passing along a supportive note on the framework to encourage
organizations to be mindful of their careless actions.
</p>
<h2>Why Is Grey Hat Hacking Useful?</h2>
<p>
    No of the reason, dark cap hacking is prohibited, as we&#39;ve already said. if
there isn&#39;t permission from the target to uncover holes, trying to violate a
company&#39;s legal protections. A grey hat coder should thus anticipate being
rejected for revealing an organization&#39;s flaw.</p>
Nevertheless, some businesses utilize their bug bounty programs to
incentivize dark cap programmers to report their findings and will pay the
incentive to reduce the likelihood that the programmer would use the defect for
personal advantage. The greatest way to ensure that a programmer stays within
the law is to acquire the organization&#39;s approval because this is an uncommon
event.</p>
Despite the worries, grey hats&#39; talents in a market with such a shortage of
skills cannot be understated. Enterprises are vulnerable to black hat tactics

since there is a clear absence of network protection capabilities. According to
McAfee&#39;s &quot;Hacking the Skills Shortage,&quot; 82% of respondents were affected by
a network security deficit, while a study by Indeed found that the number of
job postings in the field of digital security had surged by more than a third in
only two years, creating a 5% skills gap in the UK.</p>
Network security initiatives predict that over the next five years,
worldwide investment on internet security will approach $1 trillion, with 1.5
million new jobs available.
</p>
<h2>Example of Grey Hat Hacking</h2>
<p>
    Here are some well-known instances of grey hat hacking:
</p>
<h3>Routers made by ASUS</h3>
<P>
    In order to alert customers that they would have their files exposed if
they didn&#39;t repair the vulnerability he discovered, a grey hat hacker in 2014
acquired access to hundreds of ASUS routers.
</P>
<h3>Routers powered by Linux</h3>
<p>
    A security hole in specific Linux router models was identified in 2015 by
the &quot;White Team,&quot; a team of grey hat hackers. The criminal organization
released malware to plug the security gap in order to remedy the issue.
</p>
<h3 id="word3">Internet-based printers</h3>
<p>
    In order to warn people about the risks of leaving Internet printers open,
a grey hat hacker remotely seized control of more than 150,000 printers in
2017.
</p>
<h2>How important are grey hat hackers?</h2>
<p>
    Despite the fact that we did not cover every variation of hacker in this
essay, it is still vital to understand that many different people feed the
enthusiasm of hacker types. White hat hackers work to safeguard businesses or
services from bad intent. Black hat hackers will go over and above to subjugate
and make people and organisations their victims. Beyond the protection of the
internet&#39;s barrier, the battle is always in motion.</p>
Then there are grey hat hackers, a middle ground kind, who hack to
discover weaknesses without exploiting them. A particular product market can
be defended as an example. There are both excellent and passable items.</p>
Consumers strive to obtain the finestyet occasionally can only afford the best

ones. There is also a another kind that works to outdo them by maintaining a
reasonable pricing and always seeking methods to do better.</p>
Grey hat hackers resemble one another a lot. Secure transactions, mobile
applications, and financial systems may all have security issues that
organisational pen-testing staff are unable to find. If carried out to a certain
level without the appearance of grey hat hackers, those would pose a serious
threat.
