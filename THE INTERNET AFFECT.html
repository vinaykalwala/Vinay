            <h1>HOW THE INTERNET AFFECT THE YOUNG  PEOPLE</h1>

<h2>What is the Internet and how does it affect young people?</h2>
<div class="b">Today, a large number of young people utilize the Internet to create and share
    materials intended to inform, uplift, and inspire their peers on a variety of
    subjects, including but not limited to social justice, economics, politics,
    spirituality, the environment, and technology. Now, a variety of young people
    may learn about how to approach significant issues from many angles and
    minimize the impact of the numerous challenges they encounter on a daily
    basis as a consequence. Consider the blogs of Francis Wachira, Morning
    Awaits, which focuses on spiritual development, and Cynthia Nyongesa&#39;s
    Cynthia Untamed, which focuses on youth empowerment.</p>
    Adolescent talents and interests are profoundly impacted by immersion in a
    media-rich world. According to a study, people now process information and
    think differently than they did in the past. For research, education, and
    communication, they rely on media technologies. As a result, media affects
    their propensities for learning and social interaction. Additionally, they seek to
    develop the abilities needed to make creative multimedia presentations. Media
    multitasking has become commonplace. Teenagers are continuously checking
    their email, browsing the web, updating their status on Facebook, and sending
    texts.</p>
    Without a doubt, the Internet is today&#39;s most significant mass medium. Over a
    billion people use the Internet worldwide, with young people making up the
    majority, according to studies conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in
    2006. More than 90% of young people use computers frequently (100%)
    regularly use the internet.</p>
    Most young people use the Internet to interact with their friends after school,
    but they also use it to some extent to complete their homework and conduct
    research. They converse via chat rooms, emails, and wall posts on their pals.
    Young people use the internet so often that many experts, academics, and
    psychologists have started looking at how it affects young people&#39;s life. </p>
    <h4>Internet&#39;s Impact on Young People</h4>
    <P>
        The Internet and other new communication technologies have been
determined to have a greater influence on young people&#39;s lives than any
previous technological advancements. Parents and educators are worried about
children lose social skills as a result of so much social interaction occurring
online.</P>

Obesity can result from a lack of exercise caused by spending hours in front of a
computer, especially when using the internet. Long periods of sitting can also
lead to poor posture and bodily discomfort, which reduces the effectiveness of
blood flow to the legs and other body components. Occasionally, after spending
a lot of time in front of the computer, Eyesight loss is also possible. Many
young individuals who spend a lot of time in front of computers start to exhibit
indications of illnesses that are often not noticeable until later in life.</p>
Time spent in front of a computer may have a variety of effects. Today&#39;s youth
can connect online and communicate with peers growing up in other areas of
the world. Their brains are actually opened up to the possibilities of global
culture by the internet, which helps them recognize and value their variety.</p>
A very timid person who finds it difficult to engage in face-to-face
communication might spend hours online conversing with someone who may
be experiencing a similar issue at home. Young people can thus use the internet
to discover solutions to problems they might not feel comfortable asking their
parents, friends, or even professors.
    </P>
    <h4>Negative effects on Young People</h4>
    <p>
        The internet is a two-edged sword with both positive and terrible sides. To
teach their children about the ambiguity in life, parents should utilize the
internet as a teaching tool. </p>
Some studies have even shown that youngsters who use computers often might
enhance their visual, spatial, and reading abilities. </p>
Computers now only have one drawback: young people can use them alone,
away from their parents&#39; attentive eyes, and some material accessible away from
parents&#39; watchful eyes could not be beneficial for young people. The only way
to prevent this is for parents to keep an eye on their children without stifling
their increasing freedom. The younger mind may not be able to digest the
information in the right way.
    </p>
    <h4>Taking Their Confidence Away</h4>
    <P>
        Young people are so hooked on the internet that they have lost the ability to
think independently. Young people in today&#39;s society sometimes use dishonest
techniques like plagiarism when completing assignments in order to avoid
having to rely on themselves. As a result, manual labor declines, and laziness
rises.
    </P>
    <h4>Causes of Abuse of the Rights of Humans</h4>
    <P>
        People of the opposite gender who have been subjected to online harassment
have reported experiencing despair as a result of the derogatory language used
by young people to disseminate information via social media.
    </P>
    <h4>Participates in Online Crime</h4>
    <p>
        The Internet has developed into a haven for young individuals who want to
conduct cybercrime. Young people utilizing the Internet to perpetuate
crimes like stealing money from other people&#39;s accounts or getting access to
private information for financial gain or public humiliation, there has been an
increase in cybercrime. This has led to many young people getting into legal
difficulties, and they frequently run the possibility of going to jail if they are
detected.
    </p>
    <h4>Establishes Jabbering</h4>
    <p>
        Online gambling and other types of gambling are popular among young people
nowadays. Teenagers have lost a lot of money and even killed themselves.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Positive Effects on Young People
    </h4>
    <h3>Promoting Innovation and Creativity Today</h3>
    <p>
        The increased Internet penetration among today&#39;s youth has allowed
innovations like smartphone applications (like Branch and Tala) that provide
quick credit access viable. Additionally, through spending time online and
consuming material, young people are creating fresh answers to long-standing
social issues. Young people have recently pushed their government to preserve
their rights and create social justice for all through the use of the Internet.
    </p>
    <h4>help them succeed in their studies</h4>
    <p>
        The importance of the Internet has increased recently, especially in academic
contexts, as more and more young people are able to read and study resources
that are available online, like books, from the comfort of their own homes. As a
result, pupils have easier access to more resources and are therefore more likely
to succeed in school.
    </p>
    <h4>Encourage the exploitation of morals and character</h4>
    <p>
        Many young individuals squander their time online watching pornographic
video content and other films and videos that are bad for their heads.
Particularly when it comes to early sex, which has negative consequences for
their entire lives, this has taken advantage of their morality and character.
When young viewers want to mimic, this practice has the greatest detrimental
impact.
    </p>
    <h4>Improved standard of living</h4>
    <P>
        It has been essential in reducing poverty rates and generally improving living
conditions for young people to be able to find jobs online and earn extra
money. Young people also utilize the internet to promote and push for job
opportunities, where they are often
    </P>
    <h4>What Leads to the Creation of New Employment
        Opportunities?</h4>
        <p>
            In the company of young people, young people have been permitted to choose
their job choices in a variety of fields, including content writing, online product
promotion, fashion design, and new app creation. They now enjoy a greater
social standing and more robust economic development as a result.
        </p>
    <h4>Boosts the Confidence of Young People</h4>
    <p>
        Many websites and blogs emphasize how important it is for young people to
change their perspectives, pick up new skills, develop their abilities, and take
use of their opportunities. As a result, a lot of young people are discovering who
they are pushing themselves to start internet enterprises relating to their
hobbies.
    </p>
   <h4>Social media experiences of teenagers</h4>
   <p>
    Teenagers may now instantaneously interact with others and share their life
through images, videos, and status updates thanks to social media. These
platforms are cited by teens as essential for building and sustaining connections,
being creative, and expanding their worldviews. However, they also have to deal
with some of the more unfavorable effects of social media use, such as drama,
bullying, and the need to project a specific image.
   </p>
   <h3>HOW TEENS ARE REALLY AFFECTED BY THE INTERNET</h3>
   <P>
    It has grown in popularity and become a mainstay of human activity ever since
the first computer building blocks of the internet were created in the middle of
the 1960s. The teenage population of today, or Generation Z, best exemplifies
this. Particularly considering that teenagers may easily access these networks
from their smartphones everywhere they go. The average age of someone
purchasing a smartphone is just 10 years old, and it does &#39;t take long for these
young children to learn how to connect with others using these phones, too,
according to a 2017 Nielsen survey. A 2018 survey by the group Common
Sense Media found that 33%–39% of US teens say texting is their preferred
smartphone use.</P>
Teenagers appear to use YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat the most often
among social media platforms. In a 2018 Pew Research Centre poll, youths in
the US reported using YouTube 85% of the time, Instagram 72% of the time,

and Snapchat 69% of the time. The majority of US teenagers use social media,
and according to the Pew Research Centre, they have differing opinions on
how it has impacted their lives. Social media, according to 31% of US
teenagers, has a primarily beneficial influence on individuals their age, while
24% of teenagers feel it has a mostly negative impact. The primary
justifications for a positive influence were forming connections with family and
friends. whereas bullying and relationship damage brought on by a lack of in-
person interaction was cited as the primary factor for a negative influence. It&#39;s
interesting to note that, according to 45% of kids surveyed by Pew Research,
social media has neither a positive nor negative impact on individuals their age.
So it appears that Gen Z has a mixed opinion of social media after all.
