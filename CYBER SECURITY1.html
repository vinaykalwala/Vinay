            <h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>

            <div class="b">Cyber security is a procedure protecting data from electronic
                devices like computers, servers,  mobile devices, electronic
                systems, and internet-connected systems including
                hardware,software&amp;programs all data from cyber attacks. In
                modern days cyber-attacks become a more complex problem in
                the world. Nowadays this problem plays important role in
                everyone&#39;s life, why because they are losing their personal data
                whether it is company data or others. When we are losing our data
                we are losing our privacy in society. Once we lose our data it will
                affect our life.</p>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows our personal. In the present generation,
            everything is digital, we are using technology every day for
            communication, Education, Heath, governmental and industry
            information, intellectual property, business, etc, cyber security
            protects us from theft and damages all categories of data.
                </p>
            <h2>Importance of cyber security</h2>
            <p>
                In the world cyber attacks increased every day. It is necessary to
            protect our data from malicious attacks by hackers, spammers,
            and cybercriminals. Cyber security is used by companies to protect
            from phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity data
            breaches, financial losses,  personal data loss, etc. It prevents
            unauthorized access to data we should create privacy passwords
            for our personal details and records for security from cyber attacks.
            With help of cyber security companies have peace of mind
            because of unauthorized data there is no chance of data loss to
            their network and their data protection. All companies are both end
            users, organizations, and their employee&#39;s benefits.

                Network security is most important why because it will keep all our
            sensitive data safe from cyber attacks, and make sure the network
            is working, and trustworthy. Successful network security policy
            employs multiple security solutions to protect user data, and
            organizations&#39; data from malware and cyber attacks, some
            distributed denial of services. A network security system helps to
            reduce the risk of data loss,  theft, and sabotage. It includes
            firewalls that prevent illegal access to a network and antivirus.

                Authorization is nothing but a client giving permission to use or
            access a file. It is coupled with authorization and authentication.
            This is the concept we are using to access our data security.
            </P>
            <h3>Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                Encryption is like security for our applications. Data can be
            encrypted by our files involving disk, files,  database, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Logging</h3>
            <p>
                Logging is designed for security purposes, already developers use
            it for debugging and diagnostics. When we are using any
            application in runtime the applications have logging securities for
            security.
            </p>
            <h3>Application security testing</h3>
            <p>
                Application security testing is one of the most important in security
            testing our password is strengthless, and weaknesses are
            identified by source code.
            </p>
            <h2>Zero trust</h2>
            <p>
                Zero trust is a type of security used in cybersecurity in any
            organization that removes understanding of every stage of digital
            interaction. There is no chance to trust inside or outside the
            network. Verification is important in any access to resources on the
            network. Zero trust prevents data breaches. It protects the data
            from third-party access,  multi-cloud remote access, and IOT
            security and visibility.
            </p>
            <h2>Zero trust protection</h2>
            <h3>Zero trust access</h3>
            <p>
                Zero trust network used in IT security to protect secure data
            remote access to any organization&#39;s data, applications, and
            services based on the policies.
            </p>
            <h3>Multi-factor authentication</h3>
            <P>
                Authentication should reach its minimum requirement, they create
            authentication more than one distinct factor for authentication.
            Multi-factor authentications give our data safer, and more secure.
            </P>
            <h3>Real-time monitoring</h3>
            <p>
                Real-time monitoring technique used in the current state of
            channels. It will give accurate information about if any issue came.
            </p>
            <h3>Micro-segmentation</h3>
            <p>
                Micro-segmentation is used for security, and it will divide a network
            separately applying security control to each segment based on the
            requirements.
            </p>
            <h3>Trust zones and default access controls</h3>
            <P>
                Trust zones perform wide security creation of a trusted platform. It
            is used for security like debugging, peripherals, interrupts, and
            memory. easy way to secure designs.
            </P>
            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>
                Cyber security plays a crucial role in the world because it gives
            security for all data from theft and loss. Sensitive data like any
            property, personal information, health information, business data,
            and government information these type of data cyber security
            gives protection for this. In modern days cyber crimes increased
            every day because of the purpose of money, disrupting companies&#39;
            systems, any person; or provisional data, and business disruption
            all these kinds of activities involved in cyber crimes may be
            financial issues. Everyone maintains their personal data security
            either may be personal or business. Don’t give chances to cyber
            attacks. Once cyber attacks came into the world we don’t know
            whose information loos but finally it will show a negative impact on
            their personal life. everyone knows their information in society. We
            should stop this type of cybercrime.
