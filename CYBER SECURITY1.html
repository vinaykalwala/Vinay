            <h1>The definition of cyber security and importance of cyber security</h1>

            <div class="b">Cyber security is a procedure protecting data from electronic
                devices like computers, servers,  mobile devices, electronic
                systems, and internet-connected systems including
                hardware,software&amp;programs all data from cyber attacks. In
                modern days cyber-attacks become a more complex problem in
                the world. Nowadays this problem plays important role in
                everyone&#39;s life, why because they are losing their personal data
                whether it is company data or others. When we are losing our data
                we are losing our privacy in society. Once we lose our data it will
                affect our life.</p>
                <p id="word">
                    Everyone knows our personal. In the present generation,
            everything is digital, we are using technology every day for
            communication, Education, Heath, governmental and industry
            information, intellectual property, business, etc, cyber security
            protects us from theft and damages all categories of data.
                </p>
            <h2>Importance of cyber security</h2>
            <p>
                In the world cyber attacks increased every day. It is necessary to
            protect our data from malicious attacks by hackers, spammers,
            and cybercriminals. Cyber security is used by companies to protect
            from phishing schemes, ransomware attacks, identity data
            breaches, financial losses,  personal data loss, etc. It prevents
            unauthorized access to data we should create privacy passwords
            for our personal details and records for security from cyber attacks.
            With help of cyber security companies have peace of mind
            because of unauthorized data there is no chance of data loss to
            their network and their data protection. All companies are both end
            users, organizations, and their employee&#39;s benefits.

                Network security is most important why because it will keep all our
            sensitive data safe from cyber attacks, and make sure the network
            is working, and trustworthy. Successful network security policy
            employs multiple security solutions to protect user data, and
            organizations&#39; data from malware and cyber attacks, some
            distributed denial of services. A network security system helps to
            reduce the risk of data loss,  theft, and sabotage. It includes
            firewalls that prevent illegal access to a network and antivirus.
            </p>
            <h2>Network security protections</h2>
            <h5>Firewall</h5>
            <p>
                A firewall is a device in network security. The working firewall
                monitoring and filters incoming, and outgoing network traffic based
                on organizations, and established security policies previously. A
                firewall sits between the public internet and a private internal
                network.
            </p>
            <h5>Network segmentation</h5>
            <p>
                Network segmentation is a technique it will work strengthened
            security, network segmentation is a physical or virtuarchitecturalual
            approach. It is dividing a network into multiple segments, each
            segmentation acting as its own sub-network providing additional
            security and control.
            </p>
            <h5>Remote access VPN</h5>
            <p>
                Those who are working remotely access a virtual private network
            that enables users to access securely, and use applications, all
            data should reside in the corporate data center and headquarters,
            and everything should be encrypting what users send and receive.
            </p>
            <h5>Email security</h5>
            <p>
                Email security is designed to save from phishing attacks, and other
            external threats,  email-borne attack vectors. Email services have
            built-in security, if there chance of attacks we may increase
            additional solutions to protect against modern cyber threats.
            </p>
            <h5>Data loss prevention</h5>
            <p>

            network communications like email, web applications, and data
            transfer mechanisms. Most companies use network data loss
            prevention solutions to protect against the loss of sensitive
            information from the networks.
            </p>
            <h5>Intrusion prevention system</h5>
            <P>
                An intrusion prevention system is a network tool. It may be a
            hardware or software device that continuously works for malicious
            activity and take action to prevent it, like reporting, blocking, or
            dropping it, when it occurs.
            </P>
            <h5>Cloud Security</h5>
            <p id="word2">
                Cloud security is used in business security for the collection of
            procedures, and technology designed to address external and
            internal threats. It is used in part of the infrastructure, organizations
            need their digital transformation strategy and incorporated cloud-
            based tools and services. In cloud security certify your data and
            applications are accessible to authorized users. You have a
            chance to access your cloud application and information, helping
            to take action on any possible security issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Cloud security protection</h2>
            <h5>I AM</h5>
            <p>
                IAM means cloud identity and access management. This is used to
            verify users and control access rights,  issues,, and problems.
            Removing week password  80% of data breaches are facing
            problems because of stolen, default, or weak passwords. More
            users face this problem that’s why users have a chance to change
            passwords frequently.
            </p>
            <h5>Network and device security</h5>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h2>Endpoint security</h2>
            <p>
                Endpoint security is nothing but protection devices like desktops,
            laptops, mobile phones, and tablets from cyber-attacks and
            malicious threats. Endpoint security software is authorized to
            protect devices that employees use for work purposes it may
            network from cyber threats. The working process of endpoint
            security is like examining files, processes, and systems for
            suspicious or malicious activity. This type of security managed
            antivirus software, Web filtering, and application management. Its
            organizations handle all sizes of risks frnation-statestes,
            hacktivists, organized crimes, and malicious, and accidental
            insider threats.
            </p>
            <h2>Endpoint security protections</h2>
            <h5>Internet of Things (IoT)security</h5>
            <p>
                The Internet of Things when we connect networks for more
            connected devices some sensors, software, and other
            technologies, store, and share data, etc. While continuing this
            process we always focus on the protections like monitoring, and
            remediating threats on the internet.
            </p>
            <h5>Network access control</h5>
            <P>
                When users access the network more, there are certain limitations
            for accessing or controlling block access from endpoint devices.
            There is no chance with corporate security policies. The virus
            cannot enter from other devices or other organizations.
            </P>
            <h5>Data loss prevention</h5>
            <P>
                Data loss prevention mainly focuses on security detection, and

                Cyber security plays a crucial role in the world because it gives
            security for all data from theft and loss. Sensitive data like any
            property, personal information, health information, business data,
            and government information these type of data cyber security
            gives protection for this. In modern days cyber crimes increased
            every day because of the purpose of money, disrupting companies&#39;
            systems, any person; or provisional data, and business disruption
            all these kinds of activities involved in cyber crimes may be
            financial issues. Everyone maintains their personal data security
            either may be personal or business. Don’t give chances to cyber
            attacks. Once cyber attacks came into the world we don’t know
            whose information loos but finally it will show a negative impact on
            their personal life. everyone knows their information in society. We
            should stop this type of cybercrime.
