            <h1>Cyber bullying: what is cyberbullying and it's impact?</h1>
            <h2>What Is Cyberbullying?</h2>
            <div class="b">Sharing or transmitting inaccurate, damaging, or offensive material about
                someone online is considered cyberbullying. It can cross the line into being
                illegal if it involves publicly humiliating someone else by disclosing their
                personal details.1 The purpose of cyberbullying is to cause emotional,
                psychological, and occasionally even bodily harm. It is spiteful and menacing in
                character.</p>
                <p>
                    A prevalent misperception regarding cyberbullying is that it is simple to avoid
            or ignore; nevertheless, this is frequently not the case. People may use the
            internet whenever they want, thus bullying can continue for a long time.1
            Additionally, although cyberbullying is most frequently associated with middle
            school and high school, it may also happen to adults and can seriously harm a
            person&#39;s reputation.
                </p>
            <h3>Online networking offers advantages and disadvantages.</h3>
            <p>
                Although the Internet and social media platforms have improved our lifestyles
            and changed how we interact, they may also expose us to new dangers.
            One instance that can have catastrophic repercussions on young people is
            cyberbullying. When someone is threatened, abused, or degraded online, such
            as through social media posts or SMS messages, this is known as cyberbullying.
            Cyberbullying has recently attracted increasing attention and reputation due to
            its use of technology. It is a crime that does not just occur in schools or on
            playgrounds.</p>

            What promotes online bullying? It doesn&#39;t need physical power or a face-to-face
            confrontation, unlike conventional bullying. Cyberbullies may be anyone with
            access to the Internet and a digital device, such as a smartphone, computer, or
            tablet. Whether through social networking sites or instant messaging, there are
            no set hours during which it must occur.</p>
            48 percent of parents feel their children are more likely to be bullied online
            than on a playground, according to the 2016 Norton Cyber Security Insights
            Report. Parents and school administrators should prioritise finding ways to stop
            cyberbullying. But preventing bullying is a challenging task.</p>
            Because many sites don&#39;t try to confirm users&#39; genuine identities, a cyberbully
            can use an alias and maintain their anonymity. This veil of anonymity
            encourages cyberbullying and frequently serves to magnify the severity of a
            
            cyberbully&#39;s nasty and hurtful behaviour. Anyone, including small children,
            middle schoolers, and high school students, might be the target.</p>
            Cyberbullying may have a negative impact on a child&#39;s development and self-
            esteem for the rest of their life. Children sometimes struggle to know how to
            react when they are mistreated. And when they do act, they frequently don&#39;t
            fully comprehend the repercussions of their choices.</p>
            <p id="word">extremely young people may become despondent or withdraw, and in
            extremely severe situations, cyberbullying has even prompted suicide in its
            victims.</p>
            Every sort of cyberbullying that exists today has the potential to harm kids and
            teenagers.</p>
            spreading hateful rumours against them. The bully does this through open
            posts or private messaging with the aim of harming the victim&#39;s reputation or
            interpersonal connections.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Cyberbullying</h3>
            <h4>Catfishing</h4>
            <p>A cyberbully uses catfishing to prey on their victim&#39;s feelings. When a victim is
                being cyberbullied, the aggressor develops a false online identity and poses as
                someone else. The bully can then interact with a victim while posing as them,
                starting an online relationship. The victim can eventually come to trust the
                internet user and divulge private information to them. The cyberbully might
                then utilise this information to expose or humiliate the victim by making them
                look bad.</p>
            <h4>Flaming</h4>
            <p>
                Flaming is the act of publicly criticising a victim or sending them offensive
            messages. A victim of cyberbullying is flamed in an effort to provoke them into
            an online altercation.
            </p>
            <h4 id="word3">Denigration</h4>
            <p>
                By transmitting, uploading, or publishing false material about a victim online, a
            cyberbully denigrates the person. Typically, denigration takes the form of
            malicious rumours and gossip about a victim.
            </p>
            <h4>Impersonation</h4>
            <p>
                By making posts under the victim&#39;s name on social media and in chat rooms, a
            cyberbully can impersonate a victim. By doing this, a victim runs the risk of
            receiving retribution from others as a result of the bully&#39;s online comments.
            </p>
            <h4>Trickery</h4>
            <p>
                A cyberbully may get friendly with a victim to the point that the victim feels at
            ease disclosing critical information. The information the victim reveals is
            subsequently made public by the bully in an effort to degrade, defame, or
            otherwise hurt the victim.
            </p>
            <h4>Bogus profiles</h4>
            <p id="word1">
                Cyberbullies are able to create phoney internet personas on behalf of their
            targets. Without the victims&#39; permission, they can publish fraudulent content
            using these accounts in the identities of their victims.
            </p>
            <h4>Prevention</h4>
            <p>
                Cyberbullying prevention is frequently overlooked. If not completely
            eliminated, cyberbullying would be addressed or stopped with the adoption of
            an effective preventative strategy.
            </p>
            <h3>Three preventative strategies that can be taken into account are as follows:</h3>
            <h4>Follow your child on social media:</h4>
            <p id="word2">
                To some, it may seem intrusive to your child&#39;s online privacy, but you should
            follow your child on social media at the very least if you are a parent, guardian,
            cousin, close family, or other responsible adult.
            </p>
            <h4>Installing a monitoring programme:</h4>
            <p>This would be regarded as a severe invasion of privacy, yet the effects are
                lovely. This might be applied to a situation involving a young child and would
                also stop a youngster from internet adult material. Parents and guardians can
                go at the interaction records every month or every three months.</p>
            <h4>Awareness:</h4>
            <p>
                Children should be made aware of the possibility of cyberbullying as a result of
            sharing a selfie photo or video that may not be well received by others.
            Children should be given three directions. First, a definition of cyberbullying,
            guidelines for appropriate chat/talk time, and examples would allow the
            youngster to understand it better. What to share and what not to share comes
            in second. The third is to reassure the youngster that you would assist them in
            resolving the situation if, by chance, they become a victim of cyberbullying on
            any social media site.</p>
            The relationship between stopping cyberbullying and violating children&#39;s
            privacy is inverse. In other words, if we strive to boost prevention, privacy will
            be thrown out the window, and if we try to it will be challenging to stop
            bullying if you allow them unlimited privacy.
