<h1>CYBER BULLYING AND IT’S TYPES AND IT’S PREVENTIONS</h1>
<h2>What Is Cyberbullying?</h2>
<div class="b">Sharing or transmitting inaccurate, damaging, or offensive material about
    someone online is considered cyberbullying. It can cross the line into being
    illegal if it involves publicly humiliating someone else by disclosing their
    personal details.1 The purpose of cyberbullying is to cause emotional,
    psychological, and occasionally even bodily harm. It is spiteful and menacing in
    character.</p>
    <p>
        A prevalent misperception regarding cyberbullying is that it is simple to avoid
or ignore; nevertheless, this is frequently not the case. People may use the
internet whenever they want, thus bullying can continue for a long time.1
Additionally, although cyberbullying is most frequently associated with middle
school and high school, it may also happen to adults and can seriously harm a
person&#39;s reputation.
    </p>
<h3>Online networking offers advantages and disadvantages.</h3>
<p>
    Although the Internet and social media platforms have improved our lifestyles
and changed how we interact, they may also expose us to new dangers.
One instance that can have catastrophic repercussions on young people is
cyberbullying. When someone is threatened, abused, or degraded online, such
as through social media posts or SMS messages, this is known as cyberbullying.
Cyberbullying has recently attracted increasing attention and reputation due to
its use of technology. It is a crime that does not just occur in schools or on
playgrounds.</p>

What promotes online bullying? It doesn&#39;t need physical power or a face-to-face
confrontation, unlike conventional bullying. Cyberbullies may be anyone with
access to the Internet and a digital device, such as a smartphone, computer, or
tablet. Whether through social networking sites or instant messaging, there are
no set hours during which it must occur.</p>
48 percent of parents feel their children are more likely to be bullied online
than on a playground, according to the 2016 Norton Cyber Security Insights
Report. Parents and school administrators should prioritise finding ways to stop
cyberbullying. But preventing bullying is a challenging task.</p>
Because many sites don&#39;t try to confirm users&#39; genuine identities, a cyberbully
can use an alias and maintain their anonymity. This veil of anonymity
encourages cyberbullying and frequently serves to magnify the severity of a

cyberbully&#39;s nasty and hurtful behaviour. Anyone, including small children,
middle schoolers, and high school students, might be the target.</p>
Cyberbullying may have a negative impact on a child&#39;s development and self-
esteem for the rest of their life. Children sometimes struggle to know how to
react when they are mistreated. And when they do act, they frequently don&#39;t
fully comprehend the repercussions of their choices.</p>
extremely young people may become despondent or withdraw, and in
extremely severe situations, cyberbullying has even prompted suicide in its
victims.</p>
Every sort of cyberbullying that exists today has the potential to harm kids and
teenagers.</p>
spreading hateful rumours against them. The bully does this through open
posts or private messaging with the aim of harming the victim&#39;s reputation or
interpersonal connections.
</p>
<h3>Types of Cyberbullying</h3>
<h4>Catfishing</h4>
<p>A cyberbully uses catfishing to prey on their victim&#39;s feelings. When a victim is
    being cyberbullied, the aggressor develops a false online identity and poses as
    someone else. The bully can then interact with a victim while posing as them,
    starting an online relationship. The victim can eventually come to trust the
    internet user and divulge private information to them. The cyberbully might
    then utilise this information to expose or humiliate the victim by making them
    look bad.</p>
<h4>Flaming</h4>
<p>
    Flaming is the act of publicly criticising a victim or sending them offensive
messages. A victim of cyberbullying is flamed in an effort to provoke them into
an online altercation.
</p>
<h4>Denigration</h4>
<p>
    By transmitting, uploading, or publishing false material about a victim online, a
cyberbully denigrates the person. Typically, denigration takes the form of
malicious rumours and gossip about a victim.
</p>
<h4>Impersonation</h4>
<p>
    By making posts under the victim&#39;s name on social media and in chat rooms, a
cyberbully can impersonate a victim. By doing this, a victim runs the risk of
receiving retribution from others as a result of the bully&#39;s online comments.
</p>
<h4>Trickery</h4>
<p>
    A cyberbully may get friendly with a victim to the point that the victim feels at
ease disclosing critical information. The information the victim reveals is
subsequently made public by the bully in an effort to degrade, defame, or
otherwise hurt the victim.
</p>
<h4>Bogus profiles</h4>
<p>
    Cyberbullies are able to create phoney internet personas on behalf of their
targets. Without the victims&#39; permission, they can publish fraudulent content
using these accounts in the identities of their victims.
</p>
<h4>Prevention</h4>
<p>
    Cyberbullying prevention is frequently overlooked. If not completely
eliminated, cyberbullying would be addressed or stopped with the adoption of
an effective preventative strategy.
</p>
<h3>Three preventative strategies that can be taken into account are as follows:</h3>
<h4>Follow your child on social media:</h4>
<p>
    To some, it may seem intrusive to your child&#39;s online privacy, but you should
follow your child on social media at the very least if you are a parent, guardian,
cousin, close family, or other responsible adult.
</p>
<h4>Installing a monitoring programme:</h4>
<p>This would be regarded as a severe invasion of privacy, yet the effects are
    lovely. This might be applied to a situation involving a young child and would
    also stop a youngster from internet adult material. Parents and guardians can
    go at the interaction records every month or every three months.</p>
<h4>Awareness:</h4>
<p>
    Children should be made aware of the possibility of cyberbullying as a result of
sharing a selfie photo or video that may not be well received by others.
Children should be given three directions. First, a definition of cyberbullying,
guidelines for appropriate chat/talk time, and examples would allow the
youngster to understand it better. What to share and what not to share comes
in second. The third is to reassure the youngster that you would assist them in
resolving the situation if, by chance, they become a victim of cyberbullying on
any social media site.</p>
The relationship between stopping cyberbullying and violating children&#39;s
privacy is inverse. In other words, if we strive to boost prevention, privacy will
be thrown out the window, and if we try to it will be challenging to stop
bullying if you allow them unlimited privacy.
