            <p class="leading-relaxed">Mindfulness is the process of becoming aware of your thoughts and your surroundings, and being attentive is accepting your thoughts without judgment. Mindfulness is understanding the present moment rather than concentrating on the past or predicting the future.
              It is the process of being more aware of sensory stimuli such as breathing or other bodily feelings. Mindfulness decreases stress by clearing the mind of unpleasant thoughts. It aids in the reduction of anxiety caused by detrimental assumptions. </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed"> An obsessive person will get up and check the latch 10 or 15 times, continually concerned that the door is unlocked. These behaviour become habitual and are characterized by an overpowering desire to fulfil them.
              Compulsive behaviour occurs when a person continually engages in a behaviour that does not necessarily bring relief or a reward, but rather repeats the behaviour in an attempt to eliminate particular obsessions. People who indulge in obsessive behaviour frequently feel stuck by them and find it extremely difficult to stop.              
              Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health problem characterized by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. A person must have one or both of these to be diagnosed with the illness. Furthermore, the symptoms must cause anguish, and severe impairment, and consume a large amount of a person's time.</p>
