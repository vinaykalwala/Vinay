                   widespread kinds of pollution that have been recently affecting the environment
                   and pushing it to destructive limits. This kind of pollution is caused by
                   Radioactive energy, emitted by various natural and man-made sources. It can be
                   caused by Nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants, disposal of nuclear waste,
                   uranium mining, and many more that affect the air, water, soil, and other
                   components of the ecosystem. Due to this, the environment has been degrading
                   significantly, making it harder to live in. Due to the growing intensity of
                   Radioactive pollution, awareness must be raised regarding this, to understand
                   the causes, the way it impacts the environment, and the measures that could be
                   taken to serve this purpose. The blog serves this purpose and contains
                   everything from causes to solutions for Radioactive pollution that can help you
                   know more about this type of pollution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                   as the name suggests, is caused by radioactive components. Radioactive agents,
                   until a limit are naturally present in the environment. However, if the amount
                   is exceeded, it can be quite much and can be potentially dangerous to the
                   entire environment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                   this pollution contain unstable atomic nuclei, that face radioactive decay to
                   emit ionizing radiation, in the form of toxic particles, rays, and neutrons.
                   These ions react with and iodize and eventually damage everything they come in
                   contact with. While it is not possible to protect any matter from the ions in
                   the atmosphere, saving the elements of the ecosystem becomes difficult. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                   These elements when mined, or extracted, add to the radioactivity of the

                   waste elements. If the waste is disposed of as solids on the ground, it can
                   contaminate the soil, and the nearby vegetation and it can even seep deeper
                   into the ground to contaminate the groundwater as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                   Also, if such radioactive waste is released into the air, it can cause severe
                   harm to the whole ecosystem as air is required for all life forms and the air
                   polluted by radioactive pollutants can not be good for any.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                   that the radioactive waste be reduced, and treated to neutralize its toxins
                   before disposing them out of the industries and plants. This would ensure that
                   the damage caused by such particles is near zero while the environment remains
