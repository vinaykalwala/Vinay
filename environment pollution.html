              <p class="leading-relaxed"> Global Warming is the rapid rise in the average temperature of the Earthâ€™s surface. Global warming has some adverse effects on the climate, as well as natural resources like depletion of glaciers, causing ocean water levels to increase, changing the weather cycle, and affecting biodiversity. Simply put, none of the effects that global warming has on the earth is good and hence, measures must be taken to understand and reduce Global warming to reduce its effects. In the past few decades, many factors have contributed to Global Warming and this has caused the average temperature to rise by several degrees. While it may seem perfectly normal, a rise in average temperature may cause many low-temperature favored species to die, affect the coastal areas due to water rise by melting glaciers, and many health issues for us humans as well. 
                  This article is a complete guide that features the causes, impacts, and ways to tackle the issue and reverse its effects.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">Thermal pollution is any alteration from the natural weather condition in a domain and can 
                scope from rises temperatures related to the earth more industries are for industrial cooling purposes to release                
                cool water into freshet beneath large incarceration. Before there is any industries but nowadays industries increasing 
                rapidly and will increase thermal pollution because of these activities. Industries' activities expose to the environment, 
                and that will impact the environment and human health, and ecosystem whole living organisms will face more problems because of that activities.</p>

              <p class="leading-relaxed">The air that we breathe in is one of the most vital components in the survival of all living beings including microbes, birds, animals, and humans, equally. However, due to many natural and industrial factors, the quality of this air has decreased significantly making it less usable for all these beings. It has been significantly polluted by major unwanted factors like pollen that causes allergy to some, poisonous gases, and dust that are not supposed to be in the air being intaken by any living organisms. This can cause various harmful impacts on the living and the environment. As all these organisms require clean air to survive, and hence, air pollution needs to be reduced to make this air safer to live in again. However, before we can reduce air pollution, it is essential to understand the causes and impacts to find solutions to fix them. The blog enlists all aspects of air pollution and also the ways to improve air quality</p>
