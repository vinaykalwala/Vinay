         <h1>DIGITAL ECONOMY</h1>

<h2>What is the digital economy?</h2>
<div class="b">Back in the 1990s, when the internet was still a supplement to
    analog goods and services, the phrase &quot;digital economy&quot; first appeared.
    The main concern at that time was how developing digital channels may
    affect consumers and companies in the larger economy. The term
    &quot;digital economy&quot; today simply refers to any economic activity that takes
    place online. The capacity to gather, utilize, and analyze enormous
    volumes of machine-readable data in order to provide more
    individualized and meaningful experiences has actually led to the
    emergence of a data-driven economy.</p>
    Companies are now able to
    innovate new business models and economic value in ways that were
    unthinkable thirty years ago thanks to the digital economy. In fact, at
    least two-thirds of executives claim that digital business activities
    significantly aid in the accomplishment of their main corporate goals.</p>
  <h2> The importance of the digital economy</h2>
  <p>
    The digital economy is more sophisticated than merely using
technology to carry out already-existing functions on computers, despite
the fact that some businesses and individuals do so. It goes beyond
merely utilizing a computer to complete activities that were previously
completed manually or with analog equipment.
Instead, the digital economy emphasizes the chance and
requirement for businesses and people to utilize technology to carry out
those duties more effectively, quicker, and more often in a different way
than previously.</p>
<p id="word">Additionally, the phrase refers to the capacity to use technology to
carry out operations and take part in activities that weren&#39;t previously
feasible. The associated idea of &quot;digital transformation&quot; includes such
chances for current companies to do things more, differently, and in
new ways.
  </p>
  <h2>Characteristics of the Digital Economy</h2>
  <P>
    How individuals and companies connect has changed significantly
over the last ten years. Businesses have created their own business
networks to link suppliers, consumers, and internal systems, building on
the popularity of social networks. As a result, according to SAP
Business Trends, global commerce will increase and reach $65 trillion
by 2020. With the growth of the Internet of Things, which is predicted to
link 45 billion devices by 2020, the corporate environment is now filled
with limitless opportunity. One must first comprehend the five key
characteristics of the digital economy in order to properly adapt:

  <p><b>Tracked and digitalized.</b> For improved decision-making in a digital
    economy, analogue things provide digital signals that may be
    monitored, recorded, and analysed. Although the oil and gas sector has
    been at the forefront of digitization for more than 30 years, digitalized
    assets have only been used for expensive gear and equipment.
    However, as sensor technology costs fall, operators are now able to
    move more processing into the field. For instance, businesses may link
    together several oilfields to boost prediction accuracy and profitability on
    a per-well basis.</p>
    <P><b>Shared.</b> The sharing economy drives the digital economy. Companies
        will soon simply purchase what is necessary and pay as they go. Buying
        only what is required reduces inventory costs, while buying utilisation as
        a service enables businesses to pay only for the services actually
        rendered and the value obtained. Think about the potential for genuine
        cooperation between service station owners, third-party transporters,
        refineries, and consumer terminals. Tank refilling might be automated,
        best-buy scenarios could be used, and optimised truck routes for
        service station supplies could be planned by oil and gas corporations.
    </P>
    <p>
        <b>Personalized.</b> Personalization of the consumer experience is another
feature of the digital economy. Customers who choose certain brands
receive customised goods and experiences from those businesses
whenever and wherever they desire. Imagine supplying the preferred
gasoline type to a petrol station atthe precise moment it expires.
Alternatively, you may provide fleet drivers personalised routes that are
tailored to their driving styles and preferences.
    </p>
    <P>
        <b>Connected.</b> By connecting resources, vendors, employees, and
stakeholders via wireless communications, individuals are able to make
data-driven choices that enhance safety, efficiency, and visibility
throughout the organisation. Oil production may be increased by
interconnecting distant pipelines and utilising predictive maintenance.
    </P>
 <P id="word1">
   <b> Direct.</b> Additionally, the digital economy enables oil and gas firms to
cut out the middleman, do away with pointless middlemen, and
establish a more direct connection between buyer and seller. An
ecosystem that has been simplified has less friction and reduces the
entrance barrier for participants in other parts of the value chain. A
excellent illustration of more direct activities is remote service
monitoring. Utilising remote intelligence eliminates the need for full-
time, local staff by tracking, monitoring, managing, reporting, and
resolving asset concerns throughout the service lifecycle.
 </P>
 <h2>Advantages of the digital economy</h2>
 <h3>Encourages Internet Use:</h3>
 <P>
    As a result, spending on everything
    associated has skyrocketed, including hardware, technical research,
    software, services, digital communication, etc. This ensures that the
    Internet and web-based businesses will continue to exist for the
    foreseeable future.
 </P>
 <h3>Growth of E-Commerce:</h3>
 <p>
    Companies that embraced and adjusted
    to online commerce during the past 10 years have profited. The digital
    economy has caused the e-commerce sector to go into overdrive.
    Beyond only direct selling, purchasing, distribution, marketing,
    production, and selling have all advanced.
 </p>
 <h3>Additional Information:</h3>
 <p>
    Because of the internet, consumers now
    have access to more information and alternatives. For example, it
    makes pricing comparisons between firms easier. It also puts
    knowledge at one&#39;s fingertips. This is especially important for
    vacationers. Finding accommodation prices and transport timetables
    could not have been feasible before the internet economy.
 </p>
 <h3>Saves Time:</h3>
 <p>
    Previously, you had to trek into town to acquire office
    supplies. You may now place an order online and have it delivered the
    next day. Businesses benefit from lower labour expenses.
 </p>
 <h3>Reduced Costs:</h3>
 <p>
    Businesses may save money on facility rentals by
    conducting the majority of their operations online. The capacity to send
    customised items straight from a manufacturer or warehouse.
 </p>
 <h3>Online Products and Services:</h3>
 <p>
    The days of music CDs and
    movie DVDs are long gone. These items are now available to us
    digitally. Physical items are no longer in high demand. This also applies
    to financial services and insurance. There is no need to visit the bank if
    you can conduct all of your transactions online. Some products and
    services have been totally digitalized in this digital economy.
 </p>
 <h3>Discretion:</h3>
 <p>
    In the digital economy, the great majority of transactions
    and payments take place online. Cash transactions are becoming
    increasingly rare. This improves economic openness while also
    reducing illegal money and market corruption. During the 
    demonetization process, the government really advocated for online
    transactions in order to boost the digital economy.
 </p>
 <h3>Proximity:</h3>
 <P>
    Customers may address inquiries and issues with a
    manufacturer or service provider more rapidly when they use direct
    customer care channels.
    Global visibility. Companies may access additional markets now that
    goods and services are available to consumers at all times and from
    any location.
 </P>
 <h3>The digital economy is altering long-established
    manufacturing industries:</h3>
    <p>
        Agriculture has already begun to reap
        the benefits of technological advancements. Crops are linked to farmers
        via mobile applications, which provide real-time reports on quality, soil,
        and irrigation to help farmers make management decisions.
    </p>
 <h3>Reduced Entry Barriers:</h3>
 <P>
    Certain aspects of the digital economy
    make it easier for new enterprises to enter certain industries. If a
    businessperson has an original concept that gets embraced, they might
    produce a new product that competes with established enterprises. The
    internet economy has enabled previously inconceivable services,
    ranging from dating apps to online grocery deliveries.
 </P>
 <h3 id="word2">Produces critical data that can lead to new discoveries:</h3>
 <p>
    Governments and non-profit organisations may benefit from the vast
    amount of data generated by knowing more about the status of the
    economy. Using a smartphone app to track the spread of COVID-19, for
    example, may reveal the locations of growing local hotspots.
 </p>
 <h2>The disadvantages of the digital economy</h2>
 <p>
    Despite the possibilities of new start-ups, monopoly-holding firms
have grown to dominate many aspects of the digital economy. For
example, Amazon has a monopoly on online sales, forcing many firms
to use the Amazon marketplace to interact with clients who purchase
there frequently. Google and Facebook have incredibly high brand
loyalty and market domination in their respective areas. As a result, a
few tech behemoths are now extremely lucrative. Because of its
dominating position, Google can demand high prices for online
advertising, but Amazon has the market strength to undercut other
traditional bookshops.
 </p>
 <h3>Less Community:</h3>
 <p>
    A physical bookshop may act as a community
hub. It may offer events like book signings, and guests may enjoy the
sensation of browsing actual books. When the digital alternative
undercuts established enterprises, traditional bookshops go out of
business.</p>
Despite the fact that books are less expensive, the actual
connection between vendors and buyers, which was a critical aspect of
the purchase process, is no longer available.
 </p>
 <h3>The addictive aspects of technology:</h3>
 <p>
    While obtaining bus
timetables online is much simpler than on paper, this potential time
savings may be outweighed by the time we waste watching Facebook,
Twitter, and internet searches. Furthermore, the sheer volume of
information may overwhelm us and cause us to lose sight of what is
important.</p>
Because of social media, more graphic content has appeared.</p>
Because of the anonymity and distance afforded by social media, it has
become increasingly common for people to launch personal attacks,
spread theories, and exchange pornographic or violent content.
Because of the digital economy, negative content for human well-being
is growing.
 </p>
 <h3>Problems with Privacy:</h3>
 <p>
    Data collecting and utilisation are
becoming very profitable companies. Facebook collects a wide range of
user data, which political interests have acquired in order to target
individuals with highly relevant political advertisements.
 </p>
 <h3>Employment Loss:</h3>
 <p id="word3">
    As our dependence on technology grows, so
does our reliance on human resources. The growth of the digital
economy may result in considerable job losses. As operations become
more automated, the requirement for human resources decreases.
Consider internet banking as one example.</p>
In the digital economy, complex technologies and procedures are
required. Platforms must be developed and maintained by specialised
and trained individuals. These are few, particularly in rural and semi-
rural areas.
 </p>
 <h3>Significant investment:</h3>
 <P>
    The digital economy requires a strong
infrastructure, an efficient Internet, and strong mobile networks. This
entire procedure requires a significant amount of time and money. In a
developing country like ours, infrastructure and network development is
a long, time-consuming, and costly process.
