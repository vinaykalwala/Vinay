          <div>Fossil fuels are nonrenewable energy sources that are formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals. These energy sources include coal, oil (petroleum), and natural gas. Here is some information about fossil fuels:</div><div><br /></div><div>1. Coal: Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that is primarily composed of carbon. It is formed from the remains of plants that lived and died millions of years ago. Coal is extracted through mining and is primarily used as a fuel for electricity generation, industrial processes, and heating.</div><div><br /></div><div>2. Oil (Petroleum): Petroleum is a liquid fossil fuel that is found beneath the Earth's surface. It is formed from the remains of marine organisms that were buried and subjected to high pressure and heat over millions of years. Oil is extracted through drilling and is used as a fuel for transportation, heating, and the production of various products such as plastics, lubricants, and chemicals.</div><div><br /></div><div>3. Natural Gas: Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel composed mainly of methane, although it can also contain other hydrocarbons. It is formed in a similar way to oil, from the decomposition of organic matter over millions of years. Natural gas is often found in association with oil deposits or in coal beds. It is primarily used for heating, electricity generation, and as a fuel for industrial processes and transportation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fossil fuels have been the dominant source of energy for many decades due to their high energy density and ease of use. However, they have significant environmental impacts. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and global warming. Fossil fuel extraction

The reliance on fossil fuels has spurred efforts to transition towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</div>
