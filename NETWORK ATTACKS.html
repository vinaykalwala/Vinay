            <h1>All about Network attacks: a complete guide</h1>

<h2>What are network attacks?</h2>
<div class="b">A network attack is a process of accessing unauthorized or
    authorized that may organization&#39;s data or proficient or personal
    data can access with the help of different software that harms
    computer devices and other smart devices. In modern days most
    people face this problem because of more internet users in the
    world. In these network attacks these cybercriminals have more
    knowledge about the different kinds of software that distribute the
    whole network process. Accessing unauthorized and authorized
    data without that organization is an illegal process.</p>
    Network attacks are divided into two different categories first one
    active network attacks and second one passive network attacks.</p>
<h3>1.  Active network attacks :</h3>
In active network attacks, without any modification the data can
gain sensitive information without any disturbances, these planes
are highly complicated but attackers can easily gain the whole
information about any organization&#39;s information and other
personal information they can easily access the data.</p>
<h3>2.  Passive network attacks :</h3>

In passive network attacks, attackers gain only unauthorized data
and they can modify the data. That data should be encrypted and
any organization should follow more security system for their data
once that data go under the attackers that organization faces many
problems.</p>
<h2>Different kinds of network attacks :</h2>
<h3>l Inside threats :</h3>

Inside threats of the network attacks, a network
is mainly  endangered by malicious insiders, These
attackers attack big organizations&#39; systems or computers that have

more money, and some attackers attack for some personal issue
that affects their business for revenge.
Inside threats, attackers do different network attacks on their
systems like violence, espionage, and cyber-attacks. Inside threats
harm the latest technologies and users and even behavioral
analytic will help to find insider attacks easily.</p>
<h3>l Computer virus :</h3>

A computer virus is one of the network attacks, it will damage the
computers what data stored inside the computers. A computer
virus is one type of malware, this created with different and special
to transform data from one computer to another computer. This
computer virus is like poison why because approximately it will
damage 30 percent of the world&#39;s computers. Malware is like a
common virus Trojan horse or another type of virus it will damage
the different system networks. Once you click an unknown, send
any email or other links to your computer any virus infects your
computer, and all your personal information and other data you
stored in the computer everything will go under attackers.</p>
<h3>l Privilege escalation :</h3>

Privilege escalation is one of the network attacks, privilege
escalation accesses unauthorized data where people store any
information in their system but don’t put any security code or other
password or secretes .</p>
This is one of the main advantages to attackers with help of
this they can easily attack the systems with different programming
and coding techniques. Privilege escalation attacks different
applications like web applications, design flaws, etc. Privilege
escalation has two types first one is horizontal and the second one
is vertical. In cyber security, it is one of the most dangerous
network attacks.</p>

<h3>l Unauthorized access :</h3>

Unauthorized access is one of the network attacks, and without
any permissions attackers, they can access the network. Main
unauthorized access is focused on the weak password and less
protection of any social applications and their accounts, and
insider threats.</p>
Everyone should create always strong passwords for their
email or other accounts if they do this their data is a very safe and
secure place. If you don’t create strong passwords for your
account networks attackers easily access your data.</p>
<h3>l Main in-the-middle attacks :</h3>

The main in-the-middle attack is one of the network attacks, this
attack involved expropriating network traffic in the middle of your
network and external sites. If your communication networks are not
secure attackers easily attack your data sensitive data or other
organizations&#39; everything hijack their sessions.</p>
Attackers will take the user login details with the help of fake
websites, and they will modify any information like financial
information, some company details, and other personal proficient
Everything change according to their comfort.</p>
<h3>l Distributed denial of service attacks :</h3>
Distributed denial of service attacks is one of the network attacks,
if anyone using networks with different forms according to their
necessity attackers modify the data they insert false information
into their device and into your network or server that connected
and accesses the online services and sites.</p>
This is one of the dangerous network attacks why because
the present situation in the world most of the users use these
online websites for shopping, ordering, for communication that’s
why attackers focus on the online users.</p>
<h3>l Code and SQL injection attacks :</h3>
SQL injection is one of the network attacks, in this attack, attackers
use the back end database maliciously manipulate the data in your

system which may be sensitive data or any organization data or
other company&#39;s private data through the applications.</p>
It is an independent injection used to control the back end
database.SQL injection is divided into two different kinds first SQL
injection Error-based SQLI and the second is Union-based SQLI.</p>
<h3>l Phishing :</h3>
Phishing is one of the network attacks, this phishing attack reveals
your personal information like your bank details, credit card
numbers, login account passwords, your money transactions
everything will reveal because of a phishing attack. If you use any
application some fraud message came that asks for your details
for account creation if you fill in all your details they can easily
attack and get all your personal information you lose your data.
Phishing attacks are of different types like email phishing,
angler phishing, spear phishing, whaling, etc. The main target of
this phishing is users who access fake websites and enter all
information for hacking.</p>
<h3>l Malware :</h3>
Malware is one of the network attacks, this will catch all your
information, any important organization&#39;s data unique programming
to network attacks, and other services for financial gain or
revenge. It is like virus malware also called malicious software
whatever program is created for network attacks it is very harmful
to your network servers and computer devices and smart devices.
There are different types of malware like Trojans, spyware,
ransomware, and viruses.</p>
Malware is very harmful why because it steals sensitive
information that you stored on your device and when you install
harmful software on your computer any online activity everything
will reveal any information from your device. This malware
activities for money and staking passwords but most of the time
this malware is used to scan for filers or other programs in your
computer.</p>
<h3>l Ransomware :</h3>

Ransomware is one of the network attacks, it is designed by
malware software, and it is used to access encrypted files in your
system through infected emails, with the help of any messages,
and other malicious sites everything encrypted data in your
system, ransomware is one of the simple encryption algorithms.
Without any key attacker, they can block the user files and other
important data on their device. Attackers Demand for money and
important data they can blackmail those who lose the data.</p>
<h2>Network attacks protection :</h2>
<h4><b>These are the different methods used for network attacks
protection</b></h4>
<h3> Create a strong password :</h3>
Network attacks are the most common problem in modern days.
We know this is a trend because internet users increased every
day. Users when they access the internet for using different
applications and websites for their work they need to create strong
passwords for their accounts, and some fraud websites ask for
your details you should be aware of this without knowing the
proper information about any application or website don’t enter
your details that may personal details like your bank details, credit
card details, once you enter you lose data from your device, and
other problem you may face.
Always create a strong password that password should
consider different symbols, numbers, a mix of letters in upper and
lower case, and at least eight characters.
<h3> Install antivirus software :</h3>
Install antivirus software for network attacks protections. When you
download any application or are connected to different devices
easily attacks your device with different viruses adding this installs
antivirus applications to protect against network attacks.
This anti-virus easily detects any malware in your system
and always updates your system for better work performance.
<h3>Use firewalls :</h3>

For network attack protection use firewalls,  which will help to
prevent any unauthorized data access to any network these
firewalls will block all untrusted sources and other sources firewalls
will block. Firewalls are designed to allow unquestionable kinds of
traffic like email or web traffic.
<h3> Enforce security policies :</h3>
Enforcing security policies to reduce network attacks, will help
make certain devices protected in opposition to the different virus
that affects the computer devices like malware and other viruses,
users should create strong passwords. These policies restrict to
use of safe websites with strong passwords to secure access.
<h3>Monitor activity :</h3>
The main important step is to monitor activity when you monitor
any network tracking logs any doubtful work will help to easily
identify and permit security and personnel it will follow step by step
to explore and alleviate potential threats.
