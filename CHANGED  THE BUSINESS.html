            <h1>HOW THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED
                THE BUSINESS</h1>
            <div class="b"><p>Internet changes the whole world, internet impact on business. In

                advantages and disadvantages we need to use the Internet
                according to our requirement but it Internet impact different
                business fields. Before there was no Internet internet provided
                easy ways to use their businesses.</p>
                <P><h2><b>Some important elements  because of this internet impact on
                    business :</b></h2></P>
                <h3>1.  Marketing changed now digital marketing :</h3>
                <p>
                    Before the internet, everyone follows traditional marketing which
            plays an important role at that time which may be any size of
            business small size business or big size business. Whatever
            business produces any product in traditional marketing people can
            communicate directly. They can see the product and that product
            quality in this process of direct communication between producer
            and customers. With the help of traditional marketing, business
            organizations reach more customers without any Internet.</p>
            After the Internet total works are digital, in present any
            business organizations focus on digital marketing it is possible only
            Internet. Digital marketing is a present situation in the world
            maximum business organization follow this why because it is one
            of the easiest ways to market their product or other business works
            all works with the help of the internet, the internet changed
            business. Digital marketing is like advertising a product on TVS, 
            sharing information with the help of smartphones, social media,
            email marketing, pay-per-click, and search engine websites you
            can advertise your product on any page using posts on your page
            about your product, and video marketing. This digital marketing is
            a very easy way to reach more customers and is less expensive,
            and more effective.</p>
            <p id="word">Everyone uses these online marketing to create their own
            pages on their website, and social media pages for developing
            their business on any search engines, or other ways these
            businesses use proficient workers for developing business-
            educated persons who can easily understand this process and sell
            their products with better services. Customers can easily find the
            business location where products are available they can easily
            contact and buy products that they want anytime available online
            products. Many business organizations understand the customer&#39;s
            requirements and provide better quality products and services with
            the help of reviews and feedback about that product. Business
            organizations find another way to improve their business. Present
            technology improved a lot most internet users spend more time on
            social media, watching videos and blogs, and search engines. The
            Internet has more options at the right time and the right customers.
                </p>
            <h4>2. Latest ways to recruit employees :</h4>
            <p>
                For the development of their business need highly talented people
            with better skills according to the business requirements. Before
            recruiting employees business organizations conduct drives, that is
            face to face interviews, business organizations know employees&#39;
            skills directly through conversation. It process was implemented
            before the Internet.</p>
            After the internet whole process changed if any business
            organization want employees they directly go to some websites
            like Linked, and other applications with different type of application
            and websites are there many educated unemployed, and proficient
            share their profile in that application. In that profile, they know
            about that person their skills and activities everything they know

            some interviews are conducted online no need to go outside for

            candidates relevant to the work.
            </p>
            <h5>3. Fast production, administration, and support :</h5>
            <p>
                We know the internet impacts t a business in the digital world.
            Internet changes the whole process to develop their business and
            distribution of their products and services with advanced
            technologies because of Internet top companies also collaborate

            </p>
            <h5>4. Training programs for leadership and employee skill
                development:</h5>
                <P>
                    These programs are crucial for team members, project managers,
            supervisors, and corporate leaders. The availability of programs for
            developing leadership and talents was limited before the Internet.
            They mostly worked for large corporations and cities. Employee
            training took time and effort. But many things were altered by the
            internet.</P>
            Online, there are several courses on leadership for CEO&#39;s
            and managers. Employees can take online courses to learn certain
            skills relevant to the project. Anyone may view free leadership and
            skill development videos online. Education is now available on
            desktops and mobile devices. And it&#39;s now one of the largest
            things that has altered and enhanced how we conduct business.
                </P>
            <h5>5. Possibilities for international growth:</h5>
            <p>
                With the aid of the Internet, small and large businesses may
            expand their operations from a single city or nation to numerous
            
            cities and nations by employing data analysis, digital marketing,
            and e-commerce tools and procedures. Before the internet, this
            was not the case. The growth was expensive. Only local markets
            were targeted for marketing, and growth was uncommon,
            especially for small-scale businesses. But the game was altered by
            e-commerce. Anyone may now use the internet to offer their
            goods and services in any nation or place.  Deliveries of goods
            and services are increasingly made to homes. Targeting certain
            consumers, cities, and nations is made possible by several low-
            cost marketing and advertising solutions and data-driven
            decisions. And this is advantageous for companies.
            </p>
            <h5>6. More liberty, adaptability, and gains :</h5>
            <p>
                Because doing business is simple, business automation
            technologies are used, digital marketing and e-commerce are
            used, and there are growth chances, enterprises may make more
            money.Business owners can monitor even 50 offices from a mobile
            device with internet access thanks to the use of business
            automation tools, the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing,
            Artificial Intelligence, e-commerce, and digital marketing, among
            other things. Everything is connected to the internet. Businesses
            benefit from its independence, adaptability, and riches.

            <h5>7. Office furnishings, equipment, and interior design :</h5>
            <p id="word2">
                Infrastructure creation for production, administration, and
            marketing is now done differently. These days, corporate
            applications and consumer data are hosted on cloud servers,
            which lowers the cost of data administration. A laptop, printer, and
            internet connection are just a few examples of IT equipment and
            office furniture that can be found and bought online. Saving time
            and money is crucial for self-employed company owners.</p>
            Businesses may now artistically and field-specifically design
            workplace space. On the internet, there are many professional
            designers, advice articles, and inventive ways. Modern offices
            have incredibly inventive designs, which encourage increased
            productivity and ease of work.
            </p>
            <h5>8. E-Commerce :</h5>
            <p>
                Online shopping has fundamentally transformed the retail industry,
            with consumers choosing to buy what they need from their phone
            or computer rather than traveling to the main street. Additionally, it
            has expanded the market for regional companies, allowing tiny
            boutiques to now sell to other markets if they so want. Some
            companies now opt to only operate online to save money on rent
            and staffing for physical stores.
            </p>
            <h5>9. Data :</h5>
            <p>
                Over the past 20 years, there has been a significant change in the
            way that businesses handle personal data. Businesses today have
            a better understanding of their clients because of the growth of
            social media, the development of email marketing, the usage of
            cookies, and data collection forms. Companies may personalize
            customer experiences and comprehend the characters of their
            customer&#39;s thanks to data collecting, which increases revenue.
            Companies should be aware of data privacy rules and how they
            may affect their processes, even as data collecting is increasingly
            becoming a necessary tool for communicating with their
            consumers.
            </p>
            <h5>10. Speed :</h5>
            <p>
                The enhanced capacity that comes with high-speed internet has
            given organizations access to several new features. A real estate
            agent, for instance, has the bandwidth to offer and load virtual
            tours. Large graphic files may be loaded by an artist, and users
            can share bigger media assets. Online presentations can be
            produced and delivered by a sales representative. Digital
            subscriber lines (DSL), which provide high-speed access via a
            phone line, were the first step in the high-speed internet paradigm.
            Later, fiber-optic connections allowed for even faster download and
            upload rates.
            </p>
            <h5>11. Privacy and security at risk :</h5>
            <p id="word3">
                Almost everything in business has altered since the advent of the
            Internet. And the compromise of security and privacy is the largest
            and worst shift. Data from other websites may be gathered using a
            variety of computer languages. false likes and false news may
            both be produced with the use of certain technologies. On the
            internet, there are countless concerns concerning fraud and online
            banking. People who want to offer you stuff phone you every day.
            Their data includes yours. Both what you do and how you do it are
            transparent. The benefits of transparency are limited. Nobody&#39;s
            business is the public&#39;s. The fact that everything is visible and
            available online is not a bad thing.
            </p>
            <h5>12. Cost-saving business automation tools :</h5>
            <P>
                Previously, it was required for business owners and teams to sit in
