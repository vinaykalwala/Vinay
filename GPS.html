<h2>What is GPS?</h2>
<div class="b">In modern life GPS technology improved a lot, GPS stands for global
    positioning system will work with the help of satellites. Satellites place
    around our planets to trace the anything with help internet and other smart
    devices. In the world, it is very useful and helpful to the people.GPS
    tracking work depends on networks, and signals and is created with three
    major parts first satellites, second ground stations, and the third part is
    receivers. Satellites take actions like the stars in a group. Everyone knows
    these satellites give information about what&#39;s going on around the world
    through the signals.</p>
    GPS Tracking is a Global positioning system and
    it necessitates a system of 24 satellites in path and apparatus on the
    ground that can set up a human being or object’s position on Earth
    with amazing exactness. GPS Tracking
    traces three unrelated data places locating, way finding, and different
    timings. Here we are learning about global positioning system tracking
    and how it works these will explain all these things in this topic.GPS
    tracking in this paragraph you know about GPS tracking,  how it used in
    real life and what is the purpose of GPS tracking and in future how it will
    improve, etc.</p>
    Everyone knows about these GPS tracking technology actually, this
    technology started in 1960, military uses these for the purpose of their
    work, after a few years in 1983 public used this GPS tracking their life to
    find their locations by using different smart items like smartphones and
    other devices</p>
    <h2>How GPS works?</h2>
    <p>
        GPS tracking plays an important role in the world. More than 30 plus
navigation satellites revolve around Earth. These satellites send signals
from one place to another place around the world everything like
communications and other digital works is possible only because of
signals. </p>
Satellites play a crucial role because they always  deliver signals. A
GPS recipient in your mobile phone pays attention because of these
signals. When the recipient determines the length from one place to
another place with  GPS satellites, it will find your location where your
stand. </p>
GPS receivers are arranged to collect information about each and
every satellite at all  specified every minute.
    </p>
<h2>Uses of GPS tracking and types :</h2>
<h3>1. Finding locations :</h3>

Finding your location on earth where you stand or stay is possible when
you have any smart devices and your locations should have
signals the mass foundational  determination of GPS
and duration appear simple, Geo-tracking can be extremely useful to
all types of manufacturing. GPS is used in real life like-
sounding balloons, and agricultural implements, and used to find animals
for wildlife where that is located. Geo-locating or GPS  as well save
people if they have any problem. </p>
If anyone is in an emergency situation or in another remote area if
they facing any emergency situation that may any problem GPS tracking
is very helpful.GPS tracking is used personally like one-to-one persons
sharing their locations, and any industrious like transport goods and
services track vehicles like cars, trucks, trains, and other vehicles to make
sure they are all acquire to their end of the line on time and effectively.</p>
<h3>2. Navigation :</h3>

Operate in collaboration with map software, GPS authorizes users to
navigate instantaneously. Competent to be kind in a location
and obtaining the required directions if a person in a journey this
navigation is very useful to find that person&#39;s location.</p>
Using GPS tracker navigation possible this GPS tracking
technology very improved in the present situations in any industry or any

transport system it may be roadways, railways, airways,  waterways,
whatever it may be you can find the vehicle where that how much speed
that traveling like ground speed, latitude, longitude all the directions will
easily know at one place remotely. In modern days people using 
this system easily finds the person or vehicle where there are located and
how much time it takes to reach the destination.</p>
<h3>3. Tracking :</h3>

GPS tracking is used in proficient deportment like police deportment,
military deportment, firefighters, and great importantly deportment that
helps the public.GPS tracking used both positive works and some
criminals used to negative works that are harmful to the public. For GPS
tracking different deportment have different types of equipment used to
find what they want. This equipment easily finds where you or your
vehicle is located,  what type of problem you facing, and surrounding
situations like weather conditions all these will find in tracking but use
some equipment like smartphones and GPS navigation devices for the
tracking with help of this you can easily find the person.</p>
<h3>4. Mapping :</h3>

If you want to travel from one place to another place mapping is very
important it will explain which road will help you to reach your
destination, in the middle of the journey which type of towns or villages
or other areas like forest river and more touch while traveling time all this
will help to find the locations to easy to travel. In GPS tracking mapping
plays a key role and it is very helpful for a safe journey.GPS tracking
depends on the software program how they design, and how it manages
with the help of different GPS devices all these are found in mapping. For
mapping, we have applications like google maps and other mapping
applications.</p>
<h3>5. Timing :</h3>

When you&#39;re traveling from one place to another place using your vehicle
at that time how much time your journey, velocity, acceleration, speed,

distance, directions, routes, navigation, and mode of transportation all
these kinds of activities everything will be calculated in GPS tracking.</p>
<h4>GPS tracking importance in geography :</h4>
<p>
    GPS is a geographical tool, and it is very important in geography fields.
</p>
<h4>Physical geography :</h4>
<p>
    Using a global positioning system we will know about the environmental
conditions and weather patterns, and climate changes in the earth. In
different seasons different climate changes how it will affect human being
and animals. Environment conditions like rain, temperature, cool in the
rainy season how much percentage of rain will come and if there are any
cyclones, floods, humidity how many days, how much time rainfall, in
summer how much temperature daily if the temperature rises how it
affects the people and animals, in winter seasons facing many health
problems because of low temperature, all these will find in physical
geography everything will find with help of global positioning system.
</p>
<h2>GPS tracking uses different types in real life like</h2>
<h3>l Personal works </h3>

When you are using the GPS tracker through any smart devices like
mobiles, smartphones, tablets, and handheld devices, these will connect
your vehicle like a car and other personal vehicles bike if any of your
family members or any person can find your location with the help of the
GPS tracker. In accident times and other emergency times, it is very
useful to save from danger zones that’s why GPS trackers use personally.
For any illegal business like transporting goods from one place to another
place can track the vehicle when you set a GPS tracker to that vehicle you
can find which location your vehicle how much time to reach the
destination all these find in GPS tracking.</p>
<h3>l Commercial works :</h3>

As against personal GPS tools, commercial works like companies and
businesses.</p>
There is not that much difference between personal vehicle devices and
commercial devices. Personal devices only know particular information
about the vehicles. Commercial works, for example, any business
transport system that may be a roadway, waterway, or airway. If people
travel from one place to another place like the airways people travel
airplane if any problem in the medile of the traveling GPS very helps to
find that problem and solve it. Any vehicle travel one place to another
place needs proper directions, maps GPS maps uses in different
commercial works to track vehicles with the help of computer systems.</p>
<h3>l Military :</h3>
First GPS was used in the US military and later it will use public in the
1980s.GPS military to track weapons vehicles and other works to trace
anything with the help of GPS. The present military uses more advanced
GPS trackers for national safety and security purposes.</p>
<h2>The advantages of GPS tracking :</h2>

v One of the advantages of GPS tracking is you can find the best
roadways, using maps you can find the easiest roadway based on
historical data and past trips it is like smart route planning.</p>
v Using GPS tracking safety journey, and fast identify the vehicles, easy
to track your vehicle if any accidents other persons know how to
connect with your GPS tracker like your family members.</p>
v GPS tracking is like an automated real-time alert because in this GPS
tracking for most of the engineers different type of programs and
software for personal and proficient works, and commercial works.</p>
v GPS tracing provides develop better customer services based on the
uses in real life and how vehicles reach the destination from starting
point to the ending point.</p>
v This will increase productivity latest advanced GPS tracker comes into
the market every year.</p>
v It will reduce fuel usage and detention time, with the help of GPS
trackers improve your productivity and profitability.</p>
v While using these GPS takers it will improve your safety and security.</p>

<h2>The disadvantages of GPS tracking :</h2>
<P>
    v GPS is used worldwide but it needs high-quality special equipment and
better software required to track anything whatever you want.
v GPS tracking works with the help of tracker mobile device or other
smart devices phones need to track.</P>
v GPS works satellites signals if any problems happen like due to the
weather condition due to heavy rain because of this disturbed the
signals if it will not works GPS tracker will not work. Inaccuracy
navigational errors.</P>
v If people don’t have minimum knowledge about GPS trackers it will
show the negative impact many problems will rise.</P>
v GPS tacking old software only works with images and the latest GPS
tracking both route maps combined with audio that will work with
your smartphones or other devices if distracted in driving it will cause
accidents.</P>
v While driving if any signals or battery failure you&#39;re using battery GPS
trackers, signals or battery lost it will distract you from driving you
should face more accidents and other problems.</P>
v GPS devices use people who have knowledge about that, without
proper knowledge about the people may misuse this tracking system
criminal works like kidnapping, murders, and other works. If they use
GPS trackers it is easy to find, if they don’t place any GPS trackers on
their vehicles it will give a negative impact.
