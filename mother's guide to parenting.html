<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Raising adolescents might sound relaxing to
some but in reality, can be quite intimidating as they go through physical,
mental, emotional roller coasters during the teen years. Some struggle due to
their appearance while others might be growing in unhealthy environments both
of which tragically damage their mental health. This can also happen if they
feel their independence or privacy is being threatened. What teen boys and
girls need in this period of their lives is a supportive family and to be able
to communicate with their loved ones without hesitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Adolescence is a challenging period for the
child’s as well as the parents as they have to deal efficiently with the
child's tantrums without making them feel like they’reunlovedd or
misunderstood. This also creates a good relationship between the teen and the
parents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Understanding and keeping up with their
needs is by far one of the most important things that will help your child feel
emotionally supported by your actions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Communication<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Being verbal
with your adolescent children about their likes, dislikes, feelings, and
generally about their life and making them feel like home and avoiding
criticism is key to having a nice experience parenting them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Free will<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Giving them the power of making their own
decisions but not letting them out of grasp will not only make your kid feel
responsible but will also develop a sense of trust and gratitude towards you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Emotional support<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In this stage of their lives, children have
to endure a lot of criticism and hate from society, you being their safe space
in which they can be vulnerable about their feelings will help them mentally,
emotionally and will make them feel grateful for being understood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Sitting down with them once in a while and
educating them about the pros and cons of the digital world will also provide
you a medium through which you can be involved in their lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Having a clear conversation about the
importance of setting their own boundaries will help them in many ways in their
day to day lives. It will not only save them from bad company but will also get
them to invest their time in something valuable leading to a healthy and happy
life. Teens in this phase are still developing their views of the outer world and
exploring it. It's normal for them to cross paths with some sketchy people who
may lead them to practise unhealthy activity or just plainly run their precious
time by showing them false hopes or faking their feelings for your child. In
order to maintain their emotional stability, parents need to teach them how to
set healthy boundaries and not keep high expectations from anyone but always
give their best in any activity they do. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Building Trust and Respect<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Your adolescents need to feel safe to be
vulnerable around you, and if they’re choosing not to, then one will need to
carry out activities in order to develop trust in their minds.Building and
Maintaining trust and respect can be a great aspect in fostering teens with
healthy minds. Here are some ways to do the same:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 36.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><a name="_lwkjrbrm1aru"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">1.<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Active Listening<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Devote your full attention towards your
teenager when they speak to you. Have opinions about the information they share
but don't be too fixated in proving your point and asserting dominance over
their opinions. Show genuine interest in what they have to say even if it's
silly, and have a good laugh with them about it in the future years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 36.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo3; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><a name="_qm55bkfjex46"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">2.<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Be supportive<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Show your teenager that you will be by
their side no matter what the scenario is. Show them support in their career,
goals, dreams, and activity choices. Be there for them when they need guidance
without having rigid opinions and being fixated on your ideology of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Physical Changes<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Educating your teens on their drastically
changing bodies and minds will be quite helpful to make them feel comfortable
about the changes they’re undergoing. Make sure to not be judgemental or
ashamed about this topic since it’s really sensitive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">Peer pressure from society<o:p></o:p></span></h4>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Having them know that what people say about
them is just a reflection of what those people feel about themselves will make
your child see the world from a different perspective and will save them a lot
of time trying to figure out what’s wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Address common emotional challenges
teenagers face daily. The emotional gland is at it’s peak during teenage years.
This can make understanding what they feel somewhat difficult as adults might
not exactly feel what the teenagers do. But still, you need to show them love,
care, and support. Some common areas where emotions are stored in the body
include the neck, shoulders, back, hips, and stomach. Discuss ways to support
their emotional well-being, including coping with stress and emotions.
Encourage open discussions about mental health and seeking professional help
when needed because teenagers might not feel comfortable talking about their
personal experiences, thoughts, struggles and mistakes with their parents, so
it’s advised to have them seek for a professional that they feel comfortable
talking to and who can help them process their emotions and guilts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Discussing the impact of social media on
your child can be a really important aspect to get to know the mental condition
of your child. Social media can be really fun as well as damaging to young
folks as they believe what they see at this age and since not everything on the
internet is how it looks through the screens, adolescents can develop
insecurities leading to severe health conditions. Setting healthy screen-time
limits and helping them build a safe and healthy social lifestyle will help you
raise your teenagers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

big aspect of their mental as well as emotional development and their overall
well–being.Encouraging your teenagers to be independent and make their own
decisions but also navigating them will encourage them to become more
responsible, confident and capable individuals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Resolving any conflict with calmness and
respect is essential in keeping relationships healthy. Here are some tips to
teach your teens in order to avoid a heated conflict or argument:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l4 level1 lfo6;"><span lang="EN-GB">Stay calm<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Studies have found that staying grounded
while a disagreement is a major breakthrough to tackle messy fights. This not
only eventually cools down the other person but also gives you time to think
and respond. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<ol start="2" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l4 level1 lfo6;"><span lang="EN-GB">Think
     before responding<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Don’t respond at the very moment as the
brain stimulates the surrounding and generates a quick response to that
stimulation which isn’t always the best thing to say. So keep calm and think
before responding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<ol start="3" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l4 level1 lfo6;"><span lang="EN-GB">Avoiding
     judgement <o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Judging someone in a heated situation is
only going to make the situation worse and it’s not a good thing to judge
people for something they’ve done or went through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 36.0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<ol start="4" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l4 level1 lfo6;"><span lang="EN-GB">Taking
     responsibility<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Holding yourself accountable for your actions
and their consequences is a good thing to teach your children in their
developing ages. Taking responsibility can sometimes be shameful as teens tend
to do silly things here and there but doing so puts you out to be a secure
person who's not ashamed of standing up for justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Celebrating tiny things that a teenager
accomplishes can mean a lot to them, they feel like they are seen, appreciated
and loved for who they are.This will also motivate them to keep doing
activities that catch their interest and eventually help them build a secure
life for themselves. Here are some ways to show kindness and empathy to your
teenager:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;"><span lang="EN-GB">Words of
     encouragement <o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Guiding them through hard times by speaking
positively about life and the situations created gives motivation to young
minds encouraging them to not give up on their dreams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<ol start="2" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;"><span lang="EN-GB">Remembering
     date<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Remembering dates associated with important
events such as graduation, their first paycheck, birthdays, and big
accomplishments can make people feel loved and acknowledged and loved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<ol id="word3" start="3" style="margin-top: 0cm;" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;"><span lang="EN-GB">Surprise
     treats and gifts<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Treating and spoiling your adolescents once
in a while will make them feel included in your life. It can be their favourite
food from a particular restaurant, a game that they’ve been eyeing for a long
time, their favourite clothing brands can make a huge impact on their minds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Concluding this blog, I would like to
convey a direct message to all the parents out there, not just the mom’s, not
just the dad’s. Your kid is growing up to become an adult at this period of
their life, meaning that their emotions resemble a hurricane, you can think
it’s calming down but it’s actually on the verge of blowing up. Taking
precautionary measures is advised during such times. But most importantly,
acknowledge your child, love them unconditionally for who they are, accept them
for their reality and their life choices, support them in their life battles
and even in their joyful victories,don’t force them to believe what you
believe, after all, they’re allowed to have their own perspective and opinions
about things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Dear Parents,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As you indulge in the beauty of
parenthood,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>encourage you to share your
experiences with other parents to gain a different perspective for your
situation, you can also consult with younger folks who know your child to get
to their side of the story and to analyse what they’re going through that they
can’t be open to you about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The most important aspect about this journey
is to never forget that you’re not alone in this journey,and connecting with
others on this topic will give you joy, strength and valuable companionship
along the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
