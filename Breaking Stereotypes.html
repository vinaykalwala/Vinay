        <h1>Breaking Stereotypes: Redefining Motherhood in the 21st Century</h1>
        <h2><a name="_gjjysy5b152h"></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Introduction<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Since the evidence of
Human existence, stereotypes hover over Motherhood deciding what being a mother
is like. The stereotypes always come with unrealistic expectations and gender
norms that destroy an individual's mental as well as physical health. Thankfully,
young girls, women, and some men have been going against these labels that
society has been putting on them since the beginning of time and these acts are
making a change only for the betterment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p id="word" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">The concept of Modern
Motherhood is undergoing a drastic change and discarding the traditional ways
of raising a new generation from the ashes of the old parenting habits and not
aligning with society’s vial expectations anymore. In this blog, we share with
you some tips to shatter the layer of windows that might be holding you back
from being the best mother. Motherhood needs to be Redefined in each woman’s
own words to break the toxic patterns and webs that society has woven to hold
us back from reaching our full potential.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name="_56o1kx4fk7sy"></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Challenging Traditional Norms<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Historically
speaking, motherhood and traditional gender roles have been deeply influenced
by religion and culture. The role of a woman and the expectations she’s bound
to have varied from different cultures and civilizations. Here are some
perspectives from history related to motherhood:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 36.0pt; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo4; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><a name="_al68hk13z49k"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">1.<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">In almost all ancient
civilizations, women were marked as homemakers, caregivers, and mothers. Their
contribution to society was just to birth children, cook, clean, and take care
of their husbands and children. Societies like ancient Greece and Rome
idealized motherhood but women’s participation in society and taking decisions
was still limited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 36.0pt; mso-list: l2 level1 lfo4; text-indent: -18.0pt;"><a name="_1hh4jfpt8i43"></a><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">2.<span style="font: 7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">The society of this
period viewed motherhood as a woman’s highest calling and therefore being a
mother, taking care of the household chores, and centered around the home and
family was seen as the greatest honor for a woman. Education and independence
outside of these duties were prohibited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">In the 19th Century,
the Ideal woman was judged based on her skills of self-sacrificing and
nurturing, and her ability to raise well-mannered children. Motherhood was
still the central aspect of a woman’s life and she had no worth outside of that
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p id="word1" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">In the 20th century,
The feminist movement took place which challenged the usual societal norms of
what a woman should do, and thousands of people participated in this movement
asking for free will. Women of all religions and races came together to demand
freedom from oppression, sexism, and equality in society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These stereotypes have led to many women redefining their self-worth and
limiting themselves inside the four walls of their houses, being a typical maiden
and not wanting to have goals and dreams since they kept on being crushed by
the gender norms of society. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Motherhood<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Motherhood is
experienced in many ways, some good and some challenging, which reflects the
minds and nature of families in this modern world. Let’s have a look at some
different faces of motherhood:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Single motherhood
refers to a situation where a mother raises her children alone or without a
second parent being involved. There are numerous reasons why a woman might have
to become a single mother which includes tough choices, divorce, loss of a
parent, or separation. Single moms always face several challenges such as time
management, emotional support, and financial responsibilities since they are
the only adults in the household. Regardless of the challenges, many single
mothers become successful in parenting and taking care of their child's
emotional and mental well-being. They also form a network of friends and family
members to help them navigate through the journey. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">This refers to
individuals belonging to the LGBTQ+ community who become parents through means
such as adoption, surrogacy, or previous relationships. Couples of the same
gender or trans people may face backlash, legal as well as societal when
assessing parenting rights and recognition. However, there have been changes
made in many constitutions across the globe legalizing and giving recognition
to such couples and providing them equality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Blended families,
also known as stepfamilies, are formed when two partners separate and move on
to another relationship. In these families, the biological parents and the
step-parents share parenting responsibilities. These families face different
challenges like merging both of the families' cultures, parenting styles, and
ethics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name="_t7zp3w99ujyo"></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Balancing Work and Family Life<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p id="word2" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Balancing career and
family can be a challenging task for working mothers. These mothers have to
continuously juggle between their work and family life and have to perform
their very best at both of them. Childcare arrangements are something that
working mothers need to practice to manage their time. This includes daycares,
nannies, babysitters, or dropping kids off at a family member's place while
going to work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">The family members of
a working mom need to be supportive and willing to help in any form for her to
successfully carry out parenting and work simultaneously. Workplaces should
also have facilities such as flexible time arrangements, parental leaves, on-site
childcare facilities, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">oles in parenting and
encourage more involvement from fathers<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Fathers play a
crucial role in parenting and caregiving. Traditionally, fathers were seen as
the main providers of the family and the mother took over childcare and
nurturing responsibility. Since the shifting of gender roles and societal
changes, fathers are now also seen as caregivers. Fathers today indulge more in
emotional connections with their children. They engage in communication and
expressing love and hence play a vital role in farming the correct emotional
environment for their child.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">The number of
stay-at-home dads has also increased over the past years where dads prioritise
taking care of their children over their careers. Flexible working times can
also be a huge help to parents who work. Choosing different shifts or alternate
days can be helpful in this situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Outdated stereotypes
and traditional gender roles prescribe specific roles for a father and mother.
Parents who want to challenge these prescribed roles can practice the tips
below:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Studies have shown
that the presence of both mother and father is essential for the mental
well-being of a child. The absence of either may affect the child in some ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This emotional connection is vital for a child's self-esteem and overall

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Mom guilt is a
phenomenon experienced by many mothers due to societal expectations, criticism,
and self-doubt related to their parenting ethics. Society can sometimes place
unrealistic expectations on mothers, such as being full-time caregivers,
managing their careers and being successful in what they do, and engaging in
extracurricular activities with their children. The pressure of meeting these
standards can leave mothers feeling drained and not good enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Some mothers can’t
even take time for self-care because society sees it as neglecting parenting
duties and being selfish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Overcoming mom guilt
can be difficult but one needs to start somewhere. It all starts by recognizing
that feeling of guilt within oneself. Whenever you catch yourself questioning
your parenting, or managing work-family life, just take a moment to realize if
you’re doing so because of being pressured by society or social media. Here are
some strategies that one can use to overcome mom guilt:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">In this blog, we
discussed how stereotypes about Motherhood have shaped societal norms, gender
roles, and straight-up Patriarchy. It emphasizes breaking these archetypes and
redefining Motherhood in the words of a Woman. It throws light on different
faces of Motherhood which are Single Motherhood, LGBTQ+ Parenting,
Co-Parenting, Blended Families, and stepparenting. Furthermore, it highlights
the importance of embracing and supporting these different forms of motherhood
to foster inclusivity and a sense of community. By recognizing and respecting
the choices that individuals make in their parenting, career, and life paths,
we can break free from societal norms and create a more accepting and
supportive environment for all mothers. This involves extending appreciation
and recognition not only to biological mothers, but also to non-biological
caregivers such as grandparents, foster parents, stepparents, and extended
family members. These individuals play a vital role in providing love and care,
and acknowledging their contribution is an act of gratitude.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
