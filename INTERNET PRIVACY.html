            cooking when you open any website, tracking the history of what
            you browse, and different tracking methods, and accessing
            metadata.</p>

            to the customer&#39;s required what they need, these are providing
            more services at times it is very tough to provide security to all
            users why because of billions of internet users in the world.

            because they lose their data. Hackers use different types of
            software that are designed with special coding programs and

            <h3>Data breach :</h3>
            <p>
                A data breach is an activity of any information in your devices
            without the authorization of the system that data information can
            take by hackers This is the most common problem and most
            companies face this problem and lose all company data or

            data, financial data, login details, credit cards, and bank details all
            your information will go under the hackers. Once you lose the data
            you will not get back. Data breaches also called data leaks and
            data spills, and some different types of data breaches are used in
            different software with unique coding systems like insider threats,
            human error, unauthorized access, physical theft, hacking
            instructions, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>Trust leads to ignoring of privacy :</h3>
            
            In the world, many companies are there but some companies like
            Facebook are a monopoly, and this application is used worldwide.
            In this application, some people read all privacy policies if they
            need to agree that they can accept the privacy policy.</p>
            These companies provide more services with less data
            protection. Some customers ask Facebook organizations to
            change the data policy and better safety for the customers who
            use that application. Any organization when they created any
            application that organizations can understand what customers
            need like their data should be safe with better service. But
            maximum these companies focus on more their services after they
            think about data protection.</p>
            <h3>Reckless user actions :</h3>
            
            In the trending world many people are depends on the internet,
            and internet privacy plays an important role in the present day.
            Present a large number of privacy when you click on any website,
            and some websites ask you to fill in all your details on their website
            some fraud websites misuse your information.</p>
            Most operative social media customers list information
            privacy in the middle of their important values but break it down to
            get familiar with the particular privacy policies previously inscribe in
            agreements which consequence in customers allowing apart their
            right to privacy, may be presumed that companies will
            observe after their greatest interests. But some business
            organizations take benefits from their users who have less
            knowledge of privacy policy up until an incident happens.</p>
            `To be honest with customers, who have minimum
            knowledge about this privacy policy they can read all information
            that they provide certain rules for their business.This network
            privacy everything according to the business requirement and that
            is useful to the customers.</p>
            <h3>Government spying :</h3>
            
            For network privacy used in the private sector and government
            sector, for sectors, Huawei Technologies must be one of the
            largest telecommunication companies in the world started in 2019.</p>
            This company dominates markets, and this is used for digital
            surveillance for security purposes this company sold these tool&#39;s
            governments for safety and security purposes.</p>
            This government says some software used in this process
            any business organization&#39;s information to lose its data these are
            used in that situation. This work is legal this work operates
            everything under the government mass surveillance control the
            national important activities like secrete intelligence services.
            Government spies like surveillance cameras, internet surveillance,
            GPS tracking, and wiretaps everything works with internet policy.</p>
            <h3>Illegal data sharing :</h3>
            
            Some companies share without customers&#39; permission all
            customer&#39;s data is shared with third parties. Facebook releases
            one important thing in 2018 that information about Facebook
            customers without customer permission approximately 80 million
            customers&#39; profiles all their information were used for political
            advertising reasons.</p>
            Those who use this customer&#39;s information for their work
            earn millions of money but that affects the customers why because
            they feel all their information with a safe zone but companies use
            customers&#39; personal information like this. It will show the impact on
            the business organization once any organization loses trust
            business also slowly decreases.</p>
            <h3>Illegitimate data collection:</h3>
            
            Any business organization set network privacy policies that are
            very useful for without their permission no one access or share
            their data with anyone. In 2019 September one incident happen
            google accepted to pay approximately 170 million to resolve the
            declaration that it&#39;s you tube services because, without parents&#39;
            permission, you-tube services collected their personal data. But
            lawmakers complained about that, they don’t have proper
            evidence that’s why in 2018 alphabet get 138.8 billion in revenue
            and profited approximately 30.7 billion.</p>
            After this process the company decided one thing that is they
            agreed to create children&#39;s useful content if they watch any
            unwanted videos anyway, they will collect the data.Many websites
            manage according to the customer&#39;s satisfaction but customers
            don’t read all these privacy policies and rules and regulations.
            Before there is no these much-advanced technologies but now
            they will increase day by day. Every year new technologies came
            into the market with a better future that works with the help of the
            Internet. Because of this more internet user cybercriminals focus
            on top business organizations and rich people for money
            purposes.Cyber attacks most common problem nowadays
            because lack of internet privacy this is very beneficial to
            cybercriminals because they can easily access any sensitive
            information without customer permission.</p>
            <h2>Some methods to follow improve internet

            share any information that may be online links, images, or videos
            everything should be private why because of the lack of network
            privacy in the world they provide better services but less customer

            business.

            uploaded to an online account, once you lose the data you can’t
            retrieve the data. Because for an online account, creators should
            follow the minimum basic rules while creating Passwords that
            should be a minimum of eight characters including upper and
            lower case letters, special characters, soles, and numbers required

            transaction works,  ordering any items, or transport work at that
            time some organizations advertise their apps or products to click
            the link and download the app if you don’t have clarity about that
            you should avoid that type of apps and websites.</p>
            <h3>n Delete or clear all your information that you search in
            search engine :</h3>
